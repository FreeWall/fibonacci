# Fibonacci app

> create a client/server application with the following functionality:
>
> the server will provide one endpoint, which takes the number N and returns the Nth Fibonacci number, for example, F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(8)=21
>
> the client will be a SPA, consisting of one input field and a button. When the user enters a number and pressed the button, the app calls the server endpoint and displays the returned Fibonacci number. The visual design of the app is not important.
>
> We would prefer if both the client and the server are created using TypeScript, the server using NodeJS, and the client in React. You can choose any additional libraries/dependencies. You do not have to handle all edge cases but it would be good to mention them in the comments with a suggestion on how to handle them. The output of the assignment is a runnable project (projects) with a short description of how to install and run it.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/FreeWall/fibonacci
